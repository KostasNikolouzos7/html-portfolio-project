<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi everyone !! My name is Konstantinos Nikolouzos. My dream was allways to become a Web Developer , but allways something
  was happening and i couldn't find some motivation to do it due to the lack of job opportunities. But right now i found a 
  cool course so i can learn web development and finally do something about my future and create something from scrach and hopefully someone could
  see my work , and finally apply for a job so i can change my life.
